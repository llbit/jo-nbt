This is a Java library for the NBT file format used in Minecraft for storing
world data.

This is one of few NBT libraries that includes tests.

The first versions of this library were developed in 2010 as part of
[Chunky](https://github.com/llbit/chunky).  The library was moved to a separate
project in 2017 in order to reduce the complexity of the main Chunky codebase.
This library also has a more permissive license than the rest of Chunky.

The code is licensed under the Modified BSD License.
